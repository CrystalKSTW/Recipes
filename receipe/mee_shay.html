<p>Meeshay (Burmese: မြီးရှေ; MLCTS: mri: hre, pronounced [mjíʃè]; also spelt mi shay, mee shay, mee shei) is a Burmese cuisine dish of rice noodles with a meat sauce. The dish originated from the Chinese mixian (simplified Chinese: 米线) and became a specialty of the Shan people of Eastern Myanmar. Regional variants exist, but the two main types are the normal Mogok meeshay and the Mandalay version. Myay-oh meeshay (lit. 'claypot meeshay') is a Yunnanese version in which the rice noodles are cooked in a clay pot and the dish is served with a large quantity of soup and fresh vegetables.</p>
